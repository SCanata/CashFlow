# CashFlow Game Engine

This repository contains a very small Python implementation of a game engine
for a board-game clone inspired by Robert Kiyosaki's **Cashflow**.

The engine is located in the `cashflow` package. A simple command-line runner
is provided in `run.py` to demonstrate gameplay.

## Running the Example

Run the example game with:

```bash
python run.py
```

This will simulate turns for two sample players until one reaches
$50,000 in cash.
